# Logistics at OSAI

### Meetings & Events

Meeting information will be updated on the [calendar page](/calendar) (Coming Soon!)

Open-Source at Illinois also runs workshops and the _Open-Source Showcase_, where faculty and students are invited to show off their software projects.

### Verification

Run `/netid <your_netid>` on Discord to verify your affiliation with the University of Illinois.

### Attendance

Run `/attend <code>` to mark your attendance. The `<code>` is given out in the middle of the meeting, and will automatically award you points for attendance.

### Point System

This Fall, we're piloting a new point system to recognize and appreciate our members' efforts towards the club.

- You can see how many points a meeting is worth by running /events on discord, or on the [calendar page](/calendar) (Coming soon!)

- See how many points you have by running `/points` on Discord (Coming soon!)

- In general, normal meetings are worth 10 points; Socials, workshops and other events are worth 15-30 points.

- Crossing a 40 point threshold gives you the 'active' role on discord, and enables you to run for leadership positions at Open-Source at Illinois

### Github

Our projects and other software assets (including this website) are hosted on Github.

Access to join the Github organization is given to contributors of Open-Source at Illinois projects.
